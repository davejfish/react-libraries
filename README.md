Learning about using these things was both more difficult and easier than I thought, which is a weird feeling. Bulma was particularly easy to implement, just importing it and adding its custom classes to various elements for automatic styling. I did have issues installing my chart and table libraries due to seemingly the version of node and react that I am using. I forced the installation to get it to run locally, but I think I am going to run into problems with github.
